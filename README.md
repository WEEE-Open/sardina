# üêü S.A.R.D.I.N.A. üêü
Statistiche Amabili Rendimento Degli Informatici Nell‚ÄôAnno

## What

A Python script to quickly compute how much we've worked in terms of:
- yearly commits
- contributors commits
- LOC  

all three both per repository and total.

All non-archived and non-disabled public repos are taken into consideration.

## How

Count our commits:
- some üêç magic
- GitHub [APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/repos#statistics)
- the `requests` library

Count our SLOC (Source Lines Of Code): 
- `git ls-files` to list repo files
- `sed '/^\s*$/d' $file` to remove whitespace-only lines
- `wc -l` to count lines  
or, optionally
- `cloc` - a dedicated [utility](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) to count lines of code

## Why

For our yearly report and recruitment presentation.  
Also, we are curious nerds.

## I want to run it now!

First of all, generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your GitHub's [developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page.  
The token only needs access to the APIs so you can leave all the permission boxes unticked and generate a token that can only access your public information and has no control over your account, but still benefit from the 5000 API requests per hour of authenticated requests.  
Then, paste your new token in `github_pat.py`.

You can skip this step if you want and use the script without a PAT, but you will be subject to a limit of 60 API requests per hour, which means you could only fetch complete statistics for an account with at most 30 repos (we have 32 at the moment, so a PAT is highly recommended).

`git clone https://github.com/weee-open/sardina`  
`cd sardina`  
optional: `python3 -m venv venv`  
optional: `source venv/bin/activate`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
`python main.py`
